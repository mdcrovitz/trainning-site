	Description: This contains the css rules fro the header. Our design goals for small screens are:
					Place the nave menu in a menu button that shows as teh 3 bar menus
					Shrink the logo
					Place the get in touch button below the icon
					Remove the blue bar background
			These changes will need to appear here and teh in the primary-nav css file.

			NOTE: The navigatoin bar is in its own file

			Our goal is to place the header "on top of" the hero image, not as html wants
			which is to place the header in its own area. We can overlay ouree header if
			we use the position absolute tag. Additionally, placing two section in the same
			area means one will have to be on top of the other, and the default is the
			second speciotied goes on top. However, we can correct this too by giving our
			heading a z-index value that is bigger than the hero image. Since the hero image
			has no z-index, nearly anything we give the header wins for top position.
			Last, the default sizing for the element would be to minimize everything in our
			site-header. Again, we can override this by giving the rule width

			However, there is a postcss plugin we can use that extends our abilities and
