			Our goal is to place the header "on top of" the hero image, not as html wants
			which is to place the header in its own area. We can overlay ouree header if
			we use the position absolute tag. Additionally, placing two section in the same
			area means one will have to be on top of the other, and the default is the
			second speciotied goes on top. However, we can correct this too by giving our
			heading a z-index value that is bigger than the hero image. Since the hero image
			has no z-index, nearly anything we give the header wins for top position.
			Last, the default sizing for the element would be to minimize everything in our
			site-header. Again, we can override this by giving the rule width

			However, there is a postcss plugin we can use that extends our abilities and
			let's us do things like what we use below. The new plugin is postcss-hexrgba.
