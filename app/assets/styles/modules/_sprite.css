/**************************************
		File:  d:\users\mdc\documents\websites\trainning-site.dev.cc\gulp\templates\sprite.css
		Description: This is the template for svgSprite to use as he generates our
				css file that picks out individual icons from the assembled sprite file.
				In this file, we can include commands for svgSprite.

				svgSprite uses the mustash template system (the curly brackets on their sides
				sore of looks like a mustash). That is parameters enclosed within double
				curlys get acted upon.

				gulp produces a generated file: d:\users\mdc\documents\websites\trainning-site.dev.cc\app\assets\styles\modules\_sprite.css, so do not edit this directly.
				Instead, fiddle wit hthe template file and or the gulp sprite task.
